I don't treat my autism and ADHD as a weakness. Instead, I treat it like it's a part of me. And I wish that will never change :)""Being an autistic guy is definitely an eye opener. I never doubt a neurotypical person for not believing I can smell their hair from across the room, or hear a mouse in the wall. When I drive I see the road……. and trees, colors, animals, signs, trees and animals in the sign, what color their clothes are and where they’re standing. It blows my mind the things I notice that others don’t and it’s right in their faces ! I’m so sensitive that when I stand up I can feel my brain adjusting to the new central point"Case by case basis"I think autism developed evolutionarily to occur in some humans so that prehistoric tribes will have someone to blame to unite them against a common enemy. Humans see anything out of the ordinary as a potential threat because since humans in pre-agricultural societies are more likely to survive as a group rather than one individual who is more susceptible to predators. Thus, to hold these groups together we evolved to hate and/or fear anything that seems idiosyncratic. Given this information, it seems likel""""If you're looking for natural autism treatments, Planet Ayurveda is the place to go. Their products have done wonders for my family, and the improvement is incredible!""Something like Autism (due to it being a spectrum) is one of those things to where I say people who struggle with basic things (like curling up into a ball and making whale noises in a corner of a room due to being overloaded), are the ones that need help and aid, but still celebrate their minds being different. Those of us who can function relatively fine without many issues are not in need of anything but not being treated like we're lesser... and the same goes for those who do struggle badly. We're not l""I know this is probably an older video, but let's not use functioning labels.""looking back on this, this is already very outdated"Get us a effin job bruh hmu"This is a GREAT video and explains ASD very well. It just blows me away that before 1980 ASD was labeled as being ""Childhood Schizophrenia"""Autism doesnt existCelebrate us for the way we are! Recognising autism should merely be the start to creating a support system that helps us to cope with neurotypical people.Having autism is like living the life a cartoon character 24/7"Autism has been a challenging journey, but the therapeutic benefits of mushrooms has been transformative, with other psychedelics like DMT and LSD are also playing a key role in my healing and personal growth.""If the schools don't change then it's criminal to send them to a school in scotland and the government are trying to ban anyone in the UK from home schooling ,more parental responsibility taken off parents, my adult daughters won't have family of thier own because of this!"is autism people are ugly in your opinion?6:01 It’s the way autism is seen that needs correction. Including several things said in this video. Especially when talking about the spectrum. This video came out in 2021! The DSM-V had already been out for 8 years and this person couldn’t research enough to know that Aspergers *isn’t a thing anymore*. There were several misconceptions in this video and I hope less people see it so they don’t cling to misinformation."Just a heads up, high functioning doesn't mean Asperger's. All it means is low needs. In fact now they use a high needs and low needs. Or level 1, 2, 3. Someone high functioning can go from 1 end to another depending on the situation, age, etc. It actually seems to be common for many of us high functioning to be extremely high functioning in youth and go to mid to lower at times during older ages like 30s and 40s. With the once in a while high functioning. A lot of this is due to stress""Why would you ask “should we treat it with therapy or celebrate them for who they are?” When you just said that autism is not a diseases to be treated, is just a different perspective of reality….. I’ve hidden my autism for 30 years because I was told “you are not normal” … fu** off all, I’m tired. My reality is different, nothing to fix.""I wish there was a school specifically for autistic people where teachers try to give exercies that spark that super specific obession of each student and let them learn exactly what they're overly fascinated by. This way they can learn their own fields at an insanely high rate. In normal schools you're forced to do stuff that isn't interesting at all and neurotypical people can seemingly do those tasks just fine but for someone with autism, doing uninteresting things is a torture and usually ends up in not""Celebrating autism causes neurotypical people to want to be autistic and leads to false diagnoses and false self diagnoses where people purposefully pretend to be autistic to feel unique and ""better"". Having autism I'm not happy with it, I wish I was normal, I want to be social but I'm way too scared of people and trying to predict and imagine everyone's reactions to things and what people want is super exhausting.""I cannot leave the house without my noise-canceling headphones. I wear them around the house to protect myself from the kids (when they decide playing = screaming and running ??). I wear night driving glasses all day. I can't touch any sort of material that is synthetic. I am 39 now and for 30 years I tried to act like everyone else because I was told 'you are normal' and 'something is wrong with you' my entire life - teachers told me this, family, friends... But I am done. After years of understanding the h"Abnormal minds in a less abnormal world."Treat all of the other kids. They can't see anything, hear anything, understand anything in terms that aren't generalized and abstract or understand logic. Sounds like a disorder to me.""This video legitimately sums up my mind in a nutshell. There were some points made in the video that made me perk up and say ""Dear God, that's what I'm like!""."This is unintentionally (hopefully) full of disinformation."I believe that if autism is hindering the growth and social aspect of a child in a significantly negative way then it should be treated, but if its not as severe then I think we should accept them as they are, I think that a good measure of this would be the consensus of the parents and medical professionals seeing how autism is affecting the childs life and how it will affect their future going forwards and coming to a conclusion that can be changed by later choice by the therapist/and or the childs object""I heard an interesting claim once that autism is on one extreme of cognition (cognitively masculine traits) and the other extreme was schizophrenia (cognitively feminine), which is dependent on the direction of travel of signals in the brain (saggital vs cross-corpus callosum) and manifests in hypersystemitizing to the point of repetition, spurious correlation, and limited expression vs hyperempathizing to the point of attributing agency to the environment where none exists. Tldr, autists and schizos are on""I am ASD, but I do not like a routine? Do I have any other specific condition?"DR ABODA HELP MY SON WITH HIS HERBAL REMEDY AND NOW MY GRSON SPEECH DEVELOP VERY GOOD SPEAKING WELL AFTER USING THE MEDS I ORDER FROM ON YOUTUBE ON DR ABODA CHANNEL --Omg this was me my whole life and everyone would be so mad at me and I never knew why and I had already gotten diagnosed with autism but my mother didn’t tell me until I was 20 about the diagnosis and stated if you don’t know what it is why tell you and I wish she would’ve thought differently cause it impact my life and school so much like I taught myself how to read by the time I was 2 1/2 but i remember even teachers being annoyed with me saying that I “ask too many questions” even when I took psychology *DR. ABODA* ON YOUTUBE HAS THE BEST TREAT FOR HEALING AUSTIM THANK YOU SO MUCH IN MY SON LIFE.."The people making this video know zero about their subjects, Asperger’s or Autism. If they did, they would not put that music in that video at that volume.""Both I believe, it’s important that they have the tools to help and cope as well as ways of understanding how to get around things that might be difficult for them. But celebrate that it’s important to look at things differently and there’s nothing wrong with that.""Can we get to see a video on ""low latent inhibition"""ok why im like the EXACT same person as timo"Hi, i have autism! I'm not enough to be Asperger or childhood autism, but somewhere between. Anyway i do struggle a lot of emotions and people around me. I don't know what to do when people say that i do stare a lot or say that i don't speak at all. Resolve their problems about me. I don't mind if i'm too different than them with thoughts and behavior or language. Now i'm tired??""Refer ASAP to National Security Agency/ Central Protective Services CHILD DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM for lifelong guidance mentoring covert assessment management treatment protective relocation and identification documents limited diplomatic immunity as assured compliance with USDA Dietary Guidelines.
